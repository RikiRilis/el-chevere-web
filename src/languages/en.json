  "FAQ_QA_4": "Yes, at El Foto Estudio El Ch√©vere we work with the type of photo that the client desires. The final quality of the old photos will depend on how damaged the original photo is. We call this process \"reproduction\".",
  "FAQ_Q_3": "Do you also work with framing?",
  "FAQ_QA_5": "Yes. We have a wide variety of pictures for shelves and walls. The final picture and design is shown to the client in person, once the photo is printed, so that they can choose the one they like best based on the style of the photo.",
  "FAQ_Q_4": "Amateur photos",
  "FAQ_QA_6": "These are external photos, not taken in the studio. That is, photos sent by WhatsApp, by email, extracted from a USB memory stick, extracted from a CD and other external means. The price and size will depend on the user, with each size having a different price.",
  "FAQ_Q_5": "What sizes are handled?",
  "FAQ_QA_7": "We currently carry a wide variety of sizes for printed photos for shelves, walls, formal documents, etc. Sizes from 2x2 inches to 20x24 inches and other variants.",
  "FAQ_Q_6": "What if I want to have a photo shoot in a park far from the studio?",
  "FAQ_QA_8": "We also specialize in outdoor photos (outside the studio) such as weddings, baptisms, 15 years old birthdays, outdoor portraits and other styles."
